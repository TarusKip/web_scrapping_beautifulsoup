# web_scrapping_beautifulsoup
Using the Beautiful Soup library to scrap the web for newheadlines then perform sentiment analysis on the data.

The data (news headlines) will be downloaded from 3 websites: Business Daily, The Standard, Nation Africa.

The entire project will be uploaded in three files, each handling a step in the process; data collection, data cleaning and data analysis. I hope you find this project a useful for your purposes.
